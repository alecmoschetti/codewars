## Yo üï∫

Thanks for looking at my codewars repository. Like many others learning to program, my earlier attempts could be more efficient or could have better variable naming, etc. 

Using the codewars platform to practice when I just didn't have the time to work on bigger projects or to read books has helped me tremendously with my problem-solving skills. Learning how to quickly and efficiently divide problems into smaller chunks, re-state it in my own words, and generally start to think like a programmer.

Like my disclaimer above, my solutions have been, to the best of my abilities, my own work. googling chunks to my problems one line at a time, doing my best to give credit where it is due, and to operate on a good-faith basis with academic integrity.

So far, I've only been solving challenges in JS and in Rust.
Here are the links to those directories:

* [js]
* [rust]

## todo:
### active:
- [ ] separate challenges by rank (kata).
- [ ] add any relevant links or comments 
- [ ] refactor old / embarassing solutions
### completed: 
- [x] add my Rust directories.
